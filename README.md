In this Project, I've built a WebApp which Translates the Text Written by the User to Audio Format, in various available formats. This Project can be used for various purposes especially for people who are physically challenged.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
# Getting Started
To get started, create HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. After that I've used selector classes like ::selection, etc. and some webkits. I've also used media queries in this project.

## Installation
The API used in this Project is Speech Synthesis.
